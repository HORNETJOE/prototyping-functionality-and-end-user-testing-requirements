# prototyping functionality and end user testing requirements
## Prototyping
Prototyping is a useful technique for developing any product in its early stages. Prototyping is the act of producing an early modal, design or working product to show off the basic and later complex mechanics of the later product. This early prototype will be used to test the functionality of the at a stage of development where issues with the functionality of the product and be changed or removed without any issue that can come from being too far into development. These early prototypes can be of complex designs about how the product will work from start to end or they can be simple mock-up designs displaying a specific area of the product and explain how this area will work and/or how it can be improved.
