# prototyping functionality and end user testing requirements
## Prototyping
Prototyping is a useful technique for developing any product in its early stages. Prototyping is the act of producing an early modal, design or working product to show off the basic and later complex mechanics of the later product. This early prototype will be used to test the functionality of the at a stage of development where issues with the functionality of the product and be changed or removed without any issue that can come from being too far into development. These early prototypes can be of complex designs about how the product will work from start to end or they can be simple mock-up designs displaying a specific area of the product and explain how this area will work and/or how it can be improved. One method of prototyping is by using user testing.

### User Testing
User testing is when a user tests the product before it is finished to find any problems or issues with how it works or if it is suitable. The users will test specific areas of the product that the developers wish, to see if it works or has any issues with it so that can work of fixing it or carry on to other areas of the product. One way a developer can get a user to test their product is to hire game testers to test certain areas of the product, each one recording if there were any bugs or problems or if there were no issues they will carry on and investigate another area to test.

## Standard tools for prototyping
Prototyping can be achived through multible differnt tools that are widely avalible to any developer. One of these tools include writing the prototype down on paper. This can be a rough sketch of the product of one of it features and can include high level detail or just points of how it will work, what will come after and a list of issues or problems with the idea.
