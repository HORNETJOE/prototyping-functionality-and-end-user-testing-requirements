# prototyping functionality and end user testing requirements
## Prototyping
Prototyping is a useful technique for developing any product in its early stages. Prototyping is the act of producing an early modal, design or working product to show off the basic and later complex mechanics of the later product. This early prototype will be used to test the functionality of the at a stage of development where issues with the functionality of the product and be changed or removed without any issue that can come from being too far into development. These early prototypes can be of complex designs about how the product will work from start to end or they can be simple mock-up designs displaying a specific area of the product and explain how this area will work and/or how it can be improved. One method of prototyping is by using user testing.

### User Testing
User testing is when a user tests the product before it is finished to find any problems or issues with how it works or if it is suitable. The users will test specific areas of the product that the developers wish, to see if it works or has any issues with it so that can work of fixing it or carry on to other areas of the product. One way a developer can get a user to test their product is to hire game testers to test certain areas of the product, each one recording if there were any bugs or problems or if there were no issues they will carry on and investigate another area to test.

## Standard tools for prototyping
Prototyping can be achieved through multiple different tools that are widely available to any developer. One of these tools include writing the prototype down on paper. This can be a rough sketch of the product of one of it features and can include high level detail or just points of how it will work, what will come after and a list of issues or problems with the idea. Another tool that can be used to prototype would be to have the code run in a separate window to see the outcome of the code. This will allow the developer to write code and see the outcome of the code on another window to see any errors that occur or to see what the code will display to the user. Another tool that can help during prototyping would be 3D software such as Paint3D. This can allow the developer to design a 3D environment if their product takes place in a 3D world. This will allow them to sketch out their idea more like how the final product will look rather than a 2D image.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of user testing

## The different end user categorizations, classifications and behaviour modelling techniques
there are many different types of categorizations for end user which each have their own style and performance that can affect how the design and the creation of an application can take place.

The first type of end users are the casual end users. These users are the more relaxed users and therefore don't have the required knowledge as some of the higher skills user have when using an application. they make up the lower portion of users when prototyping.

The second type of users would be the knowledgeable types of end users. These users are in the middle when it comes to technical understanding when it comes to prototyping and using the application. They are not unprepared to use the application, but they are not an expert in using the application either making them the middle portion of testers.

the third type of end users would be the experts. The experts are more than capable of using and testing the application to their highest capability. The expert types of end users have a solid understanding and knowledge about the technical methods that are used within the application.

The final type of end users would the ones with disabilities that would raise issues when testing the application. These users are critical to understanding and solving issues that the application can cause for users with disabilities, making the application more accessible to a wider audience.

## prototyping methodology for a specific user type
One user type that will have a specific prototyping methodology would be the casual end users. These users would need to be introduced to the application slowly to make sure that they are not overwhelmed with too much information and one time to avoid the user getting confused. Once the user and gotten a standard understanding of how the application works they will be allowed to explore the application with help on end to provide any answers to questions they might have about the application.

## Tools to develop prototypes
there are many different tools that can be used to develop multiple prototypes. A lot of these prototyping tools are included within the developing kits/programs that are used to create the application. One of these tools would be:

#### Unity
Unity is one the top most popular development kits available and contains many functions that allows the creator to prototype their creation. One of these function is the ability to test the application at any point in this development with the ability of the play button which allows the engine to run the application with the assists and functions it has received allowing the creator to test certain parts of the application without having to finish the whole project. This also allows the creator to not worry about other parts of the application so that specific parts of the application can be focused on to improve them and to make sure they work.

## end user experiments and analysis
The end user feedback that I recived from the tasting of my applicaiton called "Traceball Game" was the the table lists below. I carried out this test by allowing the user to play the game and having them submit feedback as a comment on the game. The comment were as follows:

| User  | Feedback |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Mark Biswell  | The game was over too quick and I had no way of knowing what was happening.  |
| Luke Shead  | The lives counter on the side did not change when I got hit it confused me.  |
| Sam Dearing  | The game was over too quick and it kept repeating the game over message after the game was over.|
| Matthew Sides  | I had no time to react after I got hit the first time meaning I lost 2 of the possible lives in the game too quickly  |

following these comments some ajustsment were made to the game to improve it. Another test was conducted to see the results to see if the improvments had any effect on the comments the users would submit. This will provide fedback as to if the game has imporved since the last test or if more work has to be done.

the ajustments that were made to the game from the comment were that a text box was added to apper when the user was hit to inform them that they have been hit and to give them time to reset themselfs and start the game again. The other imporvment was the the bug that caused the "game Over" message to apper more then once was fixed so that it now only displays it once.

| User  | Feedback |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Mark Biswell  | I now know what Iâ€™m doing because of the text box appearing when I get hit. However the lives don't change.  |
| Luke Shead  | The lives still does not change when I get hit.  |
| Sam Dearing  | The game lasted a bit longer because I had time to prepare when the text box appered but the game is still short. |
| Matthew Sides  | The text box allows me to react to the red square a lot better than before and now the game lasts a longer.  |

## The appropriate set of tools to develop the plan
